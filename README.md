# Tweet-capture-and-sentiment-analysis
In this project I have extracted tweets based on topics the user provides.

After extracting the tweet, I measure the polarity of the subject given by user.
On basis of that polarity , measure the weighted mean of negative and positive.

I have used "Textblob" package for sentiment analysis.
